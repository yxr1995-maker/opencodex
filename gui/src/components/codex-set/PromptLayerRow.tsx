/**
 * One row of the prompt-layer list.
 *
 * Row kind comes from `descriptor.class`, which is LAYER_INVENTORY, which is the
 * taxonomy in devlog 001 section 4. That is the whole mapping - there is no
 * heuristic and no second table, so a row can never be classified two ways.
 *
 * A layer with no upstream off-switch renders with NO switch element at all:
 * not a disabled checkbox, not a greyed toggle. A disabled control claims the
 * capability exists and is temporarily unavailable, which is false for these
 * layers - Codex has no way to suppress them anywhere. This is ask item 9 at the
 * rendering layer; the API refuses the same ids independently.
 *
 * The wording distinction matters too. `base` and `runtime-conditional` rows have
 * no off-switch anywhere. `feature-gated` rows ARE disableable - through
 * [features], not from this page. Applying the stronger sentence to both would
 * tell a user a setting does not exist when it does.
