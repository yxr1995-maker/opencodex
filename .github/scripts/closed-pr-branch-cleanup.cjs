/**
 * Plan deletions for head branches of closed-unmerged pull requests.
 *
 * Every rule here is a safety rule, and each one exists because the opposite
 * behavior destroys work that is still referenced:
 *
 * - A branch is a candidate only when *every* pull request that ever used it as
 *   a head is closed and unmerged. One open or merged PR on the same branch
 *   keeps it, because reopening a PR whose head branch is gone cannot restore
 *   the commits.
 * - A branch that is the base of an open pull request is kept. Deleting it
 *   closes the stacked child PR that targets it.
 * - Cross-repository (fork) heads are never touched: they live in the
 *   contributor's repository and this token has no business there.
 * - A grace period after `closed_at` leaves room to reopen a PR that was
 *   closed by mistake.
 * - The branch must still POINT AT a commit one of those closed pull requests
 *   had as its head. Matching by NAME alone deletes reused work: `codex/`-style
 *   names get picked up again all the time, and a branch recreated for new work
 *   inherits the closed history of every PR that ever used that name. The tip
 *   moved, so the branch is not the closed PR's branch any more - it only shares
 *   its label.
 * - A branch whose current tip cannot be determined is kept. An unknown tip is
 *   not evidence of an abandoned branch, and this job's mistakes are not
 *   recoverable.
 *
 * @param {object} input
 * @param {Array<object>} input.pullRequests Pull requests with
 *   `headRefName`, `headRefOid`, `baseRefName`, `state`, `merged`, `closedAt`,
 *   and `isCrossRepository`.
 * @param {Array<string|{name: string, oid?: string}>} input.branches Branches
 *   that currently exist. A bare string carries no tip, which is treated as an
 *   unknown tip and kept.
