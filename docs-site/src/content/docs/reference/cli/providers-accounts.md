title: CLI Providers, Accounts, and Models
description: Provider configuration, credentials, quota, and model catalog commands.
---

These commands configure upstream providers, authenticate accounts, manage credential pools, and control the model catalog exposed to Codex.

## Providers

### `ocx provider <subcommand>`

Non-interactive provider management. Registry entries are seeded by name; a custom name requires
both `--adapter` and `--base-url`.

| Subcommand | Supported flags | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list` | `--json` | List configured providers and the remaining registry entries. |
| `add <name>` | `--adapter <adapter>`, `--base-url <url>`, `--api-key <key>`, `--default-model <model>`, `--set-default`, `--force`, `--json`, `--sync` | Add a registry/custom provider. `--force` overwrites; `--sync` refreshes a running proxy in human-output mode. |
| `edit <name>` | provider field flags, `--headers <json>`, `--json` | Edit validated live provider fields without replacing key pools. `--headers` merges custom request headers; pass `{}` or `-` to clear them. |
| `test <name>` | `--json` | Probe the real upstream model endpoint. |
| `show <name>` | `--json` | Show config with API keys masked. |
| `remove <name>` | `--json` | Remove a non-default provider; the last provider cannot be removed. |
| `set-default <name>` | `--json` | Select an existing provider as the default. |
| `selected <name>` | `--set <ids>`, `--clear`, `--json` | Read or update the provider model allowlist. |
| `quota` | `--refresh`, `--json` | Read provider quota reports. |
| `presets` | `--json` | List dashboard provider presets. |
| `account-mode` | `pool`, `direct`, `--json` | Select pooled or direct Codex account routing. |

```bash
ocx provider list --json
ocx provider test ark
ocx provider add anthropic --api-key sk-ant-... --set-default --sync
ocx provider add local-dev --adapter openai-chat --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1
ocx provider show anthropic --json
ocx models --provider anthropic --json
ocx models live --provider ark --json
```

:::caution[Custom headers are not a credential channel]
`--headers` is for non-secret request metadata — routing hints, tenant or
project selectors, tracing ids. It is **not** a place to put authentication
material, and the validator rejects the standard credential header names
(`Authorization`, `X-Api-Key`, `Cookie`, and the rest) with a pointer to
`apiKey` / `authMode`.

The validator cannot recognize an arbitrary name such as `X-My-Token`, so the
boundary is yours to respect. Two reasons it matters:

- The JSON is a command-line argument, so a secret in it lands in shell history
  and in the process list, where any other process on the machine can read it
  before the CLI ever redacts anything.
- Header values are persisted in `config.json` in cleartext, unlike API keys,
  which have their own storage and masking path.

Use `--api-key` or an OAuth login for anything secret.
:::

## Authentication

### `ocx login <provider>`

Start the provider's registered login flow. OAuth providers open a browser and store auto-refreshed
credentials under `~/.opencodex/`; API-key login providers open their key dashboard, prompt for the
key, validate it when possible, and save the resulting provider config. The command prints the
currently accepted OAuth and API-key provider ids when the name is missing or unknown.

Use the same command to **reauthenticate** after `ocx status` / `ocx doctor` reports
reauthentication required or a terminal refresh failure (or use Reauthenticate in the dashboard).
Codex pool accounts are not a public `ocx login` provider — reauthenticate via the dashboard Codex
account pool (Reauthenticate) or the headless `ocx account reauth` flow instead.

```bash
ocx login xai
ocx login anthropic
```

A proxy that is already running picks up the new credential without a restart: the CLI asks it to
reload that one provider from disk, and the request carries no credential of its own. If the
running proxy cannot accept that request — most often because it started from a build that predates
attested reload — the login still succeeds and the credential is still written to disk, but the
live process keeps serving the previous one. The CLI says so and asks you to restart:

```
⚠️  A proxy is running but could not reload this provider (unattested-target).
   The credential is saved to disk; the running proxy keeps using the previous one.
   Restart it to pick this up: ocx restart
```

### `ocx logout <provider>`

Remove the stored OAuth credential for a provider.

## Accounts and key pools

### `ocx account <subcommand>`

List and switch provider accounts and API-key pools through the running proxy. The shipped help
surface is:

```text
Usage: ocx account <list|current|use|refresh|auto-switch|priority|login|reauth|code|cancel|remove|add-key|reset-credits> ...

list [provider]     Codex account pool, OAuth accounts and API keys (identifiers shown masked as the API returns them).
current <provider>  Show the active account or key.
use <provider> <id> Switch the active credential; 'main' selects the Codex App login.
refresh <provider>  Force-refresh Codex or provider quota reports.
auto-switch <provider> <on|off|status|threshold N>  Control the Codex pool threshold.
priority <provider> <id|main> [first|earlier|normal|later|last|-100..100|reset]  Selection order; omit the value to read it.
remove <provider> <id> --yes  Remove a stored account or key after an existence check.
add-key <provider> [--label <label>]  Add a key read only from piped stdin.
login/reauth/code/cancel  Run browser or manual-code auth from a headless shell.
reset-credits <id|main> [--consume --yes]  Inspect or consume Codex reset credits.
Switching the active account takes effect immediately; running threads move on their next request, and in-flight requests keep the account they captured.
A selection-order change applies from the next unbound request and never moves a bound thread.
```

All subcommands require the proxy to be running; the CLI auto-resolves its recorded runtime port.
Successful operations exit 0. Invalid usage, an unknown provider or account/key id, an unreachable
proxy, or an API failure exits 1. Credential fields are displayed exactly as the management API
returns them (including its masking); raw API keys and OAuth tokens are never returned. Display
conveniences are synthesized client-side, same as the dashboard: `main` is the CLI alias for the
Codex App login in the `openai` account pool, OAuth accounts without an email appear as `Account N`,
and the plan/label column falls back across plan, masked email, label, and masked key.

`--json` account rows use this common shape (optional fields are omitted when unavailable):

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "type": "codex | oauth | api-key",
  "id": "__main__",
  "label": "plus",
  "email": "m***@example.com",
  "plan": "plus",
  "masked": "sk-ab****wxyz",
  "priority": 0,
  "active": true,
  "needsReauth": false,
  "quota": null
}
```

### `ocx account list [provider] [--json] [--all] [--quota [--refresh]]`

Without a provider, lists the Codex pool, OAuth accounts, and configured API-key pools. Empty
providers are skipped unless `--all` is present. With a provider, lists only that credential family.
Human output uses `PROVIDER TYPE ID PLAN/LABEL PRIORITY STATUS`; a manually chosen Codex row is marked
`selected`. `PRIORITY` is the signed Codex selection order (`0` when unset) and shows `-` for rows
where ordering does not apply, such as OAuth accounts and API keys. When a stored Kiro account exists, the output notes that Kiro has one login slot and
that signing in again replaces the current account. An empty result is still success. `--json`
returns:

```text
{ accounts: AccountRow[], notes: string[] }
```

`--quota` adds a `QUOTA` column with each account's own usage, for providers that support a
per-account probe (Anthropic today). It is opt-in because the proxy probes the upstream once per
stored credential; the default listing stays a local read. `--refresh` bypasses the cached
result. An account with no per-account quota shows `-`, and one whose probe failed shows
`unavailable` — blank would read as "no usage" rather than "not measured". `--json` carries the
full breakdown per account, not just the two summarized windows:

```text
$ ocx account list anthropic --quota
PROVIDER   TYPE   ID        PLAN/LABEL         PRIORITY  STATUS  QUOTA
anthropic  oauth  1278f8da  a***r@examp***.com  -                5h 7% wk 62%
anthropic  oauth  e112f28b  k***1@examp***.net  -        active  5h 9% wk 45%
```

### `ocx account current <provider> [--json]`

Shows the active account or key. A Codex pool with no manual pin reports the priority-aware
automatic selection: the highest-priority eligible tier is chosen, and the lowest-usage account
within that tier is selected under quota routing; another family with no active credential reports
that state and still exits 0. `--json` returns:

```text
{ provider, type, activeId: string | null, autoSwitchThreshold?: number, account: AccountRow | null }
```

### `ocx account use <provider> <account-or-key-id|main> [--json]`

Selects an existing Codex account, OAuth account, or API key. For `openai`, `main` selects the Codex
App login. A Codex Pool selection clears process-local affinity and applies to the next request,
including one from an existing visible task; proxy restart or affinity eviction can also leave a task
unbound, while in-flight requests keep their captured account. This controls Pool routing only;
Direct mode keeps using the caller-owned/native main credential. Usage-based proactive switching,
401/403 reauthentication, 429/retry-after cooldowns, exclusion, and pre-output 429/402 failure
recovery may later select another eligible Pool account. Those recovery paths remain active when
usage-based switching is off. OpenCodex replays the conversation after an account change, but the
provider-side prompt cache may be cold. Unknown providers or ids exit 1.
On a **401/403**, App login clears that account's process-local affinity and requires reauthentication.
On a **429**, opencodex honors `Retry-After`, starts the account cooldown, clears affinity, and may
rotate the request to another eligible Pool account. These failure transitions remain active with
`autoSwitchThreshold: 0`; that setting disables only usage-based proactive switching.
`--json` returns:

```text
{ ok: true, provider, type, activeId }
```

### `ocx account refresh <provider> [--json]`

For the Codex pool, use `ocx account refresh openai [--json]`. It force-refreshes account quotas and
prints available weekly/monthly percentages and reset times; missing quota data is reported as
unknown, not 0%. Its JSON envelope is `{ accounts: AccountRow[] }`, with `quota` on each Codex row.

For OAuth and API-key providers, this force-refreshes the provider quota-report endpoint; it is not a
token re-login or a plain account-list re-read. `--json` returns
`{ provider, report: ProviderQuotaReport | null }`. A provider with no supported quota report prints
`no quota report available for <provider>` and exits 0. Unknown providers and management-API
failures exit 1; an upstream quota probe that fails or times out degrades to a null or stale report
instead (exit 0), matching the dashboard's quota bars.

### `ocx account auto-switch <provider> <on|off|status|threshold <0-100>> [--json]`

Controls only the `openai` Codex account pool. `on` sets 80%, `off` sets 0%, `status` reads the current
value, and `threshold <n>` accepts an integer from 0 through 100. Other providers and invalid values
exit 1. `--json` returns:

```text
{ provider, autoSwitchThreshold: number, enabled: boolean }
```

### `ocx account priority <provider> <account-id|main> [<-100..100|first|earlier|normal|later|last|reset>] [--json]`

Reads or sets one Codex pool account's selection order: **higher is used earlier**, the default is
`0`, and the range is `-100` through `100`. Only the `openai` Codex pool is ordered, so other
providers exit 1. `main` targets the Codex Desktop login, which is ordered like any other pool
account — `ocx account priority openai main last` is how you keep it as the reserve.

Preset words stand in for small integers: `first` is `+2`, `earlier` is `+1`, `normal` is `0`,
`later` is `-1`, and `last` is `-2`. `reset` returns the account to the default and drops its stored
entry. **Omitting the value reads** the current order instead of writing one.

Ordering picks which accounts are considered first, not which are usable: selection still runs among
eligible accounts, taking the highest order tier that still has quota headroom and leaving
`accountPoolStrategy` to choose inside it. Pause, cooldown, and reauthentication are unaffected.
Changes apply from the **next unbound request**, not only from newly started sessions: preemption moves
an unbound request up as soon as a higher order regains headroom. Threads already bound to an account
normally keep it until that account is drained; a reauthentication failure, a quota cooldown, or a
transient-failure streak releases the binding before that. Any accepted write also releases a manual
"use this account now" pin, on whichever account held it, including a write that stores the
order an account already had — this is the only way to clear a pin while keeping the account
that is currently selected. (Clearing the active account through the management API releases a
pin too, but it drops that selection along with it.) An unreachable proxy, an
unknown account id, or a value outside the accepted set exits 1. `--json` returns:

```text
{ ok: true, provider, id, priority: number, preset: string | null }
```

### `ocx account login|reauth|code|cancel ...`

Run browser-based or manual-code account authentication from a headless shell. Use
`ocx account --help` for the provider-specific command shape. If a Codex account login is saved but
its model-catalog refresh remains pending, human output still exits successfully and prints fixed
`ocx sync` recovery guidance on stderr. `--json` keeps stdout parseable and carries
`catalogRefreshPending: true` in the completed login state without the human warning.

### `ocx account remove <provider> <id|main> --yes [--json]`

This guarded, non-interactive deletion requires `--yes`. Before deleting, it verifies that the id
exists; a missing id exits 1 without sending DELETE. The main Codex App login cannot be removed, so
`remove openai main --yes` is refused. After deletion, the family is read again: removing the pinned
Codex account clears the pin and returns to automatic selection; OAuth promotes the first remaining
account or reports none; API-key pools promote the first remaining key or report none. `--json`
success and failure shapes are:

```text
{ ok: true, provider, id, removedActive: boolean, promotedActiveId: string | null, catalogRefreshPending?: boolean }
{ error: string } // stderr, exit 1
```

`catalogRefreshPending` is present on Codex removals only. When it is `true`, the account deletion is
already saved; human output prints generic `ocx sync` recovery guidance on stderr and still exits 0.
OAuth-account and API-key removal envelopes do not gain this field.

### `ocx account add-key <provider> [--label <label>] [--json]`

Adds and activates a key for an API-key provider. The key is read only from non-TTY piped/redirected
stdin; interactive TTY input, empty input, OAuth/Codex providers, and API failures exit 1. The key is
never echoed, including when it appears inside a label. Prefer a secret manager or a here-string:

```bash
ocx account add-key openrouter --label personal <<< "$OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
security find-generic-password -w openrouter | ocx account add-key openrouter --json
```

`--json` returns `{ ok: true, id: string | null, label?: string }` and never includes the key.

### `ocx account reset-credits <id|main> [--consume --yes]`

Inspect Codex reset credits for an account. Consuming a credit is destructive and requires both
`--consume` and `--yes`.

### `ocx account main <subcommand>`

Manage named native Codex main-login profiles without changing OpenCodex account-pool routing:

```text
ocx account main doctor [--json]
ocx account main list [--json]
ocx account main register <label> [--json]
ocx account main add <label>
ocx account main switch <profile-id-or-label> --yes [--json]
ocx account main recover [--rollback --yes] [--json]
```

Each mutating command reports the canonical effective `CODEX_HOME` returned by the running proxy.
This path can differ from the caller's `CODEX_HOME`; commands that support JSON expose the same
value as `effectiveCodexHome`.

Version 1 supports file-based Codex authentication, encrypts stored profiles with AES-256-GCM, and
keeps the encryption key in the operating-system credential store. `add` stages the official Codex
login flow before importing the resulting credential. Close Codex before switching profiles; a
successful switch preserves local tasks and history, then requires Codex to be restarted. Use
`doctor` to inspect profile state and `recover` to finish or roll back an interrupted transition.
`switch` accepts either the profile ID or its label.

The v1 recovery matrix covers an OpenCodex process exiting after a transaction file has been
published by rename. It does not claim durability across an OS or kernel crash or sudden power
loss: `atomicWriteFileAsync()` does not `fsync` either the file or its parent directory.

The encrypted vault, switch journal, recovery marker, and journal quarantine live in the canonical
`<real CODEX_HOME>/.opencodex-native-main-profiles` directory, so every OpenCodex instance sharing
that Codex home observes one owner and one recovery state. Plaintext login staging remains isolated
under each `<OPENCODEX_HOME>/native-main-profile-staging` directory.

Before native-main traffic or journal recovery is admitted, the lifetime owner takes the exclusive
credential claim and removes only exact `auth.json.ocx.<pid>.<sequence>.tmp` crash residues. Each
candidate must remain a single-linked regular file under the unchanged canonical `CODEX_HOME`; it is
truncated, flushed, and then unlinked. Link/reparse substitutions, identity changes, and other
ambiguity keep native-main traffic closed, while near-miss names are never removed automatically.
This protects against cooperative OpenCodex crashes, not a malicious process already running as the
same OS user. That user and the filesystem containing `CODEX_HOME` remain trusted, and truncation
does not promise physical erasure from copy-on-write storage, snapshots, or SSD remanence.

Preview builds used `<OPENCODEX_HOME>/native-main-profiles`. That layout is never imported silently.
If `doctor` reports legacy profile state, stop every OpenCodex proxy sharing the same `CODEX_HOME`.
Then either back up and move the matching `*.vault.json`, `*.journal.json`, recovery marker, and any
referenced journal-quarantine file together into the canonical directory while preserving owner-only
permissions, or remove the old preview set and run `ocx account main register` again. Do not choose
between multiple old roots or run both layouts while any sharing proxy is active.
On Windows, preview state keyed by the former case-folded home identity must be reset rather than
moved because its encrypted AAD and operating-system keyring identity are intentionally not reused.

## Models

### `ocx models [subcommand]` · `ocx model <subcommand>`

`ocx model` is an alias of `ocx models`. With no subcommand, list the models statically seeded in
configured providers. `--provider` filters one configured provider and `--json` returns model
metadata. `live` reads the running catalog; `add`, `edit`, `remove`, and `list-custom` manage manual
catalog entries; `enable`, `disable`, and `provider` control visibility; `selected` controls a
provider allowlist; `context` controls provider context caps; and `shadow` manages background
shadow-call interception.

Every per-model operation the dashboard offers is available here, so a headless install never needs
the GUI to manage a catalog. `add`, `remove`, and `list-custom` work against the config file and apply
to a running proxy through a catalog sync; the rest talk to the live management API and require the
proxy to be running (`ocx start`, or an installed service).

| Subcommand | Supported flags | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list` (default) | `--provider <name>`, `--json` | List models seeded in configured providers. |
| `live` | `--provider <name>`, `--json` | Read the running catalog, including models discovered at runtime. Rows are flagged `native`/`routed`, `custom`, and `enabled`/`disabled`. |
| `add <provider> <modelId>` | `--display-name <name>`, `--context-window <tokens>`, `--modalities <text,image,audio>` | Register a model the provider catalog does not advertise. |
| `edit <custom-id>` | `--model-id <id>`, `--display-name <name\|->`, `--context-window <tokens\|0>`, `--modalities <text,image,audio\|->`, `--json` | Edit a custom model. `-` clears a field; `0` clears the context window. |
| `remove <custom-id\|provider/modelId>` | `--yes` | Delete a custom model. Requires `--yes` when stdin is not an interactive terminal. |
| `list-custom` | `--json` | Show all custom models with the `custom-id` the other subcommands take. |
| `enable <provider/model\|native-model>` | `--native`, `--json` | Make one model visible to Codex. |
| `disable <provider/model\|native-model>` | `--native`, `--json` | Hide one model from Codex. |
| `provider <name> <on\|off>` | `--json` | Enable or disable every model of one provider in a single write. |
| `selected <provider>` | `--set <id,id...>`, `--clear`, `--json` | Read or replace the provider model allowlist. `--clear` removes the allowlist so every model is offered. |
| `context <status\|value <tokens> [--set-all]\|provider <name> on [--value <tokens>]\|provider <name> off\|all <on\|off>>` | `--json` | Read or set the context-window cap, globally or per provider. `value <tokens> --set-all` also re-points every routed provider (like the dashboard toggle); without it the value only becomes the default. `provider ... on --value <tokens>` sets an explicit cap for that provider only (`--value` is valid with `on` only). |
| `shadow <status\|set> [model\|-]` | `--enabled <on\|off>`, `--json` | Read or set the replacement model for Codex's background helper calls. `-` clears the model. `status` also reports `sourceModels`, the helper slugs the proxy intercepts (default: `gpt-5.6-luna`; clients through 0.144.x used `gpt-5.4-mini`, which an explicit `sourceModels` override can restore). |

```bash
ocx models live --json                                  # what Codex can actually see right now
ocx models disable anthropic/claude-haiku-4             # hide one routed model
ocx models enable gpt-5.6-sol                           # no slash, so it is treated as native
ocx models provider zenmux off                          # hide a noisy provider wholesale
ocx models selected anthropic --set claude-opus-5,claude-fable-5
ocx models selected anthropic --clear                   # drop the allowlist again
ocx models add deepseek deepseek-v4 --display-name 'DeepSeek V4' --context-window 128000 --modalities text,image
ocx models list-custom --json                           # read the custom-id for edit/remove
ocx models remove deepseek/deepseek-v4 --yes
```

A model selector with a slash is routed (`anthropic/claude-opus-5`); a bare id is treated as a
native OpenAI model, so `--native` is only needed to force that reading for an id that would
otherwise look routed.

`--modalities` accepts only `text`, `image`, and `audio`. Codex parses that field as a closed enum
and rejects an entire catalog containing any other value, so `add`, `edit`, and the management API
all refuse the bad value rather than storing something the catalog writer would have to strip later
(#759).
