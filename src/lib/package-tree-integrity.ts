/**
 * How long an `ok` observation is reused before the manifest is stat'd again.
 *
 * `status()` runs on `/healthz`, `/readyz` and every `/v1/*` request, so an unthrottled guard
 * adds a filesystem syscall to the proxy's hot path to detect an event that happens at most
 * once per install. A replaced tree is not time-critical either: the process is already
 * serving broken imports, and one more second of that is not worse than a syscall per turn
 * forever.
 *
 * A NEGATIVE result is never cached — once the tree looks wrong, every later request re-checks,
 * so a repaired install recovers on its own instead of staying refused for a window.
